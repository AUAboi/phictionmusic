Phiction is an emerging electronic music producer and DJ from New Orleans, Louisiana, known for his euphoric, high-energy sound that blends moody atmospheres, spacey synths, and groovy basslines. His music—often described as both trance-like and melodic, yet grounded by dancefloor-driven rhythms—creates an immersive experience that resonates with listeners. While others recognize a distinct signature in his productions, Phiction simply makes music that feels right, focusing on what excites him in the moment.

His journey began in the early 2000s, inspired by his father, a techno DJ, sparking his curiosity about how music was created and performed. At just 10 years old, he bought his first set of turntables, experimenting with their internals to connect them to his PC. In 2012, he discovered music production through Ableton, initially remixing popular songs before transitioning into hip-hop production from 2014 to 2017, recording vocals for local rappers. Between 2017 and 2022, he explored a variety of genres, from trap and reggae to electronic instrumentals, before ultimately rediscovering his love for house and techno in 2023, reigniting his passion alongside his father’s return to DJing.

Since then, Phiction’s sound has evolved, earning recognition from established artists such as Tommy Trash, Bass Kleph, and Jimi Frew. Beyond production, he is actively involved in the underground scene through We Didn’t Planet, a growing music event community where he helps run sound, organize events, and perform. Focused on uniting artists and fostering new opportunities, the project is quickly making waves.

Currently releasing music independently, Phiction is determined to sign with a major label by the end of 2025. His upcoming release, With You, will feature a three-track remix EP with contributions from rising EDM artists, marking another step in his artistic evolution. With a dedication to crafting emotionally charged, high-energy tracks, Phiction continues to shape his own lane in the electronic music landscape.
